A Fourier transform is a mathematical transform decomposing functions based on space and time into functions based on spatial or temporal frequency. The Fourier transform is denoted by adding a circumflex to the symbol of a function:

\begin{align*}
f \rightarrow \hat{f}
\end{align*}

The Fourier transform is defined as:

\begin{align}
\hat{f} (\xi)= \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}f(x) e^{-2 \pi i x \xi}dx
\end{align}
Whereas the inverse Fourier transform is denoted as:

\begin{align}
{f} (x)= \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}\hat{f}(\xi) e^{2 \pi i x \xi}d\xi
\end{align}

\section*{Introduction}

    The Fourier Transform is an important mathematical concept. It has applications
    in digital signal processing, convolution in neural networks, image recognition and even speech processing.
    The main idea behind the Fourier Transform is that it is a 
    "mathematical operation that changes the domain (x-axis) of a signal from time to frequency," \cite{Maklin:2019}.
    The particular use case for the Fourier Transform that initially started this project was that of 
    digital signal processing, specifically the conversion of analog signals to digital for guitar effects processing.
    When first researching the methods used to sample analog signals for conversion into digital, the Discrete Fourier 
    Transform is impossible to avoid. Using the Fourier Series, it is apparent that any complicated wave form can be taken,
    and represented as an infinite series of sine and cosine functions \cite{Liu:2021}.

    Unforunately, the Discrete Fourier Transform is on the slower side for algorithms, being performed in $O(n^2)$.
    But by using a divide and conquer strategy, an algortihm called the Fast Fourier Transform (hereby referred to as the FFT),
    is formulated. The FFT is quite a bit fast than the DFT, being performed in $O(n\log{}n)$ time. The FFT can be easily
    implemented using a recursive programming method, but there are benefits to using an iterative implementation. 
    Parallel implementations can use less index computations, as well was being able to be parallized far more easily
    than a recursive version.

\section*{Parallelization} 
    
    There are a few different directions to explore when developing a more
    parallized implementation of the Fourier Transform. 
    According to Anthony Blake in his thesis paper titled "Computing the Fast Fourier Transform on SIMD Microprocessors",
    use of the FFT algorithm is extremely widespread in multiple disciplines. He goes on to state that 
    "use of the FFT is even more pervasive, and it is counted among the 10 algorithms that have had the greatest influence 
    on the development and practice of science and engineering in the 20th century," \cite{Blake:2012}.
    The widespread use of the FFT algorithm provides great evidence for the need to optimize for different applications,
    and to understand the methods that can be used to achieve this.
    Two methods of Parallelization that stand out in particular are SIMD, and multithreading.
